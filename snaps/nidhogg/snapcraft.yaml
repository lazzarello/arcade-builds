description: |
  Outsmart your opponents with all kinds of weapons in this life or death tug-of-war that ends in the belly of a flying worm.
  The next installment of the epic award-winning dueling tug-of-war is coming! Stab, shoot, slice, or stomp your opponent to gain control of the screen, then book it to your side of the arena. Before long, a new opponent will appear in your way. If they kill you, they get control. Get all the way to your end of the arena to winâ€“and be devoured by the Nidhogg. Enjoy new monstrous visuals by artist Toby Dixon and bangin beats from Mux Mool, Daedelus, Doseone, and more!
